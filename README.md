# Support our small businesses in Fort Collins

Many of our favorite Fort Collins businesses are closed for now, or have had to limit their interaction with customers. While business is not as usual right now, we can still support our community by shopping online ðŸšš or buying gift cards to spend later â€“ all from a healthy distance.

Please use this list to find social-distancing-friendly purchasing options at your favorite shops, restaurants, cafÃ©s, and more. Let's do what we can to keep our local economy up and running!
